# Student-Expense-Analyzer
**Name:** Matthew Swantee
**Description:** This program tracks weekly student expenses using JavaScript arrays. It demonstrates how to transform data (map), filter specific categories (filter), and calculate totals (reduce).

### Callback functions
In this project, callbacks are used inside every array method:
- Inside `.forEach()`, the callback defines how to print each item.
- Inside `.map()`, the callback defines how to change the price.
- Inside `.filter()`, the callback defines the rule for which items to keep.
- Inside `.reduce()`, the callback defines how to add the amounts together.
